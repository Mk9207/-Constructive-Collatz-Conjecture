## Constructive Proof of the Collatz Conjecture

We demonstrate constructively that every positive integer under the Collatz function eventually converges to 1. The proof employs stepwise cycle analysis, shrinkage of non-trivial orbits, and merging trajectories under modulo-class tracking to verify total convergence.
